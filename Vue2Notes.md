- Options API
- Virtual DOM (template syntax or render functions with JSX)
- Reactive data variables
- Vue utilizes `this` so don't use arrow functions
- Lifecycle hooks
  - beforeCreate
  - created
  - beforeMount
  - mounted
  - beforeUpdate
  - updated
  - beforeDestroy
  - destroyed
- `v-html` to bind HTML (but it's prone to XSS vulnerabilities)
- Directives (`v-bind`, `v-on`, `v-if`, `v-for`, etc.)
- Modifiers (eg.: `v-on:submit.prevent`)
- Computed properties
  - Reacts to changes to the dependant data
  - Basically getter functions
  - For complex and commonly used template logic (eg.: `message.split('').reverse().join('')`)
  - Computed props are cached compared to methods that always re-evaluate (run) when re-render occurs
  - Can have setters if needed
- Watchers
  - Computed props are better for new prop values, but if some other form of reactivity is required (side effect based on props) than watchers can be the solution
  - Perform async operations
- `<template>` to group elements together (like Reacts `<></>`)
- `key` can be used for lists, but also to prevent the re-use of elements
- `v-show` is useful for a lot of re-renders and evaluations (higher initial render cost, but less cost when state changes)
- `v-for` can iterate over objects as well and accepts a second argument for index or keys (eg.: `v-for="(item, index) of items"`)
- Use `$emit` to emit custom events from child components
- `v-model` is basically the same as `v-bind:value` and `v-on:input` together
- `<slot>` can be used to insert content into components
- `<component v-bind:is="currentTabComponent">` can be used to dynamically change components based on logic
- `data` should be a function that returns an object in components
- `props` should define the initial state of data in child components so those should be assigned to the child's `data`
  - But objects and arrays are passed as reference so that can mutate the original object/array
- Parent and child components have **one-way-down binding**: when parent data changes that propagates down to the child, but when props change in child it wont propagate up to the parent
